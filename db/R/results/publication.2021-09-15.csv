In humans, mutations in HNF1B lead to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, pancreas atrophy, and maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 and genital malformations. We report HNF1B screening in a cohort of 377 unrelated cases with various kidney phenotypes (hyperechogenic kidneys with size not more than +3 SD, multicystic kidney disease, renal agenesis, renal hypoplasia, cystic dysplasia, or hyperuricemic tubulointerstitial nephropathy not associated with UMOD mutation). We found a heterozygous mutation in 75 (19.9%) index cases, consisting of a deletion of the whole gene in 42, deletion of one exon in one, and small mutations in 32. Eighteen mutations were novel. De novo mutations accounted for 66% of deletions and 40% of small mutations.

TCF2 mutations are known to be responsible for the maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5 associated with renal manifestations. Several observations have suggested that TCF2 mutations may be involved in restricted renal phenotypes. Eighty children (median age at diagnosis 0.2 yr) with renal cysts, hyperechogenicity, hypoplasia, or single kidneys were studied. Quantitative multiplex PCR amplification of short fluorescence fragments for the search of large genomic rearrangements and sequencing for the detection of point mutations were performed.

However, the functional role of HNF-1.. in insulin secretion and glucose metabolism is not fully understood. We identified a family with early-onset diabetes that fulfilled the criteria of MODY. Sanger sequencing revealed that a heterozygous P159L (CCT to CTT in codon 159 in the DNA-binding domain) mutation in HNF1B was segregated according to the affected status. To investigate the functional consequences of this HNF1B mutation, we generated a P159L HNF1B construct. The wild-type and mutant HNF1B constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells in the presence of the promoter sequence of human glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2).

However, in 60% of the patients with a phenotype suggesting MODY5, no point mutation is detected in TCF2. We have hypothesized that large genomic rearrangements of TCF2 that are missed by conventional screening methods may account for this observation. In 40 unrelated patients presenting with MODY5 phenotype, TCF2 was screened for mutations by sequencing. Patients without mutations were then screened for TCF2 rearrangements by the quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF). Among the 40 patients, the overall detection rate was 70%: 18 had point mutations, 9 had whole-gene deletions, and 1 had a deletion of a single exon. Similar phenotypes were observed in patients with mutations and in subjects with large deletions.

Transplant failure from chronic rejection and subsequent transplant nephrectomy allowed discontinuation of corticosteroids, the gradual withdrawal of insulin and normoglycemia. The recent description of renal cysts and diabetes (RCAD) syndrome and a strong paternal family history of early-onset diabetes mellitus prompted genetic screening of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta gene.

Mutations in the gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1beta have been associated with early-onset diabetes and nondiabetic renal disease-particularly renal cystic disease. We investigated a possible role for the HNF-1beta gene in four unrelated GCKD families and identified mutations in two families: a nonsense mutation in exon 1 (E101X) and a frameshift mutation in exon 2 (P159fsdelT). The family members with HNF-1beta gene mutations had hypoplastic GCKD and early-onset diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.

We found heterozygous mutations in 21 (23%) of 91 cases of renal malformation. All mutation carriers had abnormal fetal renal ultrasonography. Plasma magnesium levels were available for 66 patients with chronic kidney disease (stages 1 to 3). Striking, 44% (eight of 18) of mutation carriers had hypomagnesemia (&lt;1.58 mg/dl) compared with 2% (one of 48) of those without mutations (P &lt; 0.0001).

A 44-year-old Japanese man who had been diagnosed with early-onset non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus at the age of 23 was examined. He showed multi-systemic symptoms, including a solitary congenital kidney, pancreatic hypoplasia, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, elevation of the serum levels of liver enzymes, hypomagnesemia, and hyperuricemia. These clinical characteristics, in spite of the absence of a family history of diabetes, prompted us to make the diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young 5 (MODY 5). One allele deletion of the entire HNF1B gene revealed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) led us to the diagnoses of 17q12 microdeletion syndrome even though there were negative chromosomal analyses with array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). 17q12 microdeletion syndrome, which is not ra",2020-05-22,Endocr J,Endocrine journal,"17q12 microdeletion syndrome; HNF1B; Sporadic maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) 5; Adult; Calcium; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Gene Deletion; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-beta; Humans; Japan; Liver; Magnesium; Male; Pancreas; Syndrome; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",Omura,Yoshiyuki,2021-09-15

Permanent NDM (PNDM) is caused by mutations in specific genes that are known for their expression at early and/or late stages of pancreatic beta- cell development, and are either involved in beta-cell survival, insulin processing, regulation, and release. The native population in Qatar continues to practice consanguineous marriages that lead to a high level of homozygosity. To our knowledge, there is no previous report on the genomics of NDM among the Qatari population. The aims of the current study are to identify patients with NDM diagnosed between 2001 and 2016, and examine their clinical and genetic characteristics. To calculate the incidence of PNDM, all patients with PNDM diagnosed between 2001 and 2016 were compared to the total number of live births over the 16-year-period.

To date, mutations in 11 genes have been frequently associated with this phenotype. In Brazil, few cohorts have been screened for MODY, all using a candidate gene approach, with a high prevalence of undiagnosed cases (MODY-X). We conducted a next-generation sequencing target panel (tNGS) study to investigate, for the first time, a Brazilian cohort of MODY patients with a negative prior genetic analysis. One hundred and two patients were selected, of which 26 had an initial clinical suspicion of MODY-GCK and 76 were non-GCK MODY. After excluding all benign and likely benign variants and variants of uncertain significance, we were able to assign a genetic cause for 12.7% (13/102) of the probands.
